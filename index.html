					<section>Brief remark on QM vs QFT (intermediate vs external wave packet formalism)</section>
					<section>Transition probability with intermediate wave packet formalism</section>
					<section>Giunti 1991 getting first explicit results with Gaussian wave packet (figure of a Gaussian)</section>
				</section>
				<section> <!-- Wave packet treatments -->
					<section>Justification for Gaussian wave packets? Can obtain analytic results...</section>
					<section>Giunti quote</section>
					<section>Problems with this justification--can have non-Gaussian wave packets. Explain different moments of a distribution. Cite Gaussian wave packets paper on what condition is</section>
					<section>Introduce Lorentzian wave packets (with equation + figure... comparing to Gaussian?) in the context of Mossbauer neutrinos (cite). Explain how cannot be approx by Gaussian</section>
					<section>Introduce RMU wave packets, give covariant definition + figure. Relate parameters to observables. Why should we consider these wave packets?</section>
				</section>
				<section> <!-- RMU wave packets -->
					<section>To motivate RMU wave packets let us reconsider Gaussian WPs (put RMU WPs faded off to side)</section>
					<section>Introduce Heisenberg-Robertson uncertainty relation between position and momentum -> Gaussians are minimum uncertainty wave packets</section>
					<section>Robertson-Schrodinger uncertainty relation -> squeezed Gaussian</section>
					<section>Introduce relativistic velocity (Newton-Wigner localisation)</section>
					<section>Position-velocity uncertainty relation, RMU WP as minimum uncertainty WP. cite Al-Hashimi and Wiese + Polish group</section>
					<section>Show RMU wave packets are Gaussian in non-rel limit but Lorentzian (and hence non-Gaussian) in ultrarel limit</section>
				</section>
				<section> <!-- Results & discussion -->
					<section>Get plots of transition probabilities as a function of... what? (check literature + past talks by Giunti). Compare results of different WPs</section>
					<section>Discussion of decoherence... RMU wave packets maintain their form while Gaussians spread out</section>
					<section>Ask whether different mass RMU wave packets will separate over course of propagation. Equal velocities?</section>
					<section>Briefly discuss equal-velocity WP controversy. Check whether expectation value is being broken up over v=p/E. Also discuss non-sharply peaked energies and momenta from WPs at production and detection (external WP formalism?) Peak/mean can unity but spread/variance can be very large</section>
